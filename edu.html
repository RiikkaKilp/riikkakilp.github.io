                During this week-long intensive course, we taught the basics of Unity, game programming and game development. 
                I was one of the two Unity coaches, and our job was to create the course materials, a learning schedule and be there for 
                the students and help them with their projects. I found out that I enjoy teaching people and helping them with their first experiences in game development.
