											<h2>About Me</h2>
										</header>
										<header class="minor">
											<h2>Who?</h2>
										</header>
										<p>I'm Riikka Kilpeläinen, a dev with experience 
											and interest in game graphics, programming and production, 
											 all things games. Worked as a producer, an art lead and a VR-programmer.
											 I also happen to be the
											  local seamstress and a hardcore naptime 
											  enthusiastic.
										</p>
										<header class="minor">
											<h2>Hobbies</h2>
										</header>
										<p>
											I enjoy various types of games, that have shorter sessions or gameplay that does not need your constant attention. 
											Overwatch, Prison Architect, Last of Us and Minecraft are titles I hold	close to heart, each for their own reasons.
											<br><br>
											Outside of gaming, I enjoy tinkering around with my aquariums, 
											sewing and learning about 3D-graphics. Game jams give me life 
											and allow me to fully exercise my jack-of-all-trades -muscles and 
											love for prototyping. It's not unheard of to find me at networking events, so hit me up
											if you happen to see me!

											Feel free to contact me on LinkedIn and check out my projects at ArtStation, Sketchfab and Itch.io.

											<h2>Games</h2>
										</header>
										<p>
											Here are my published titles and some other accomplishments. I have mostly worked in lead positions, be it as a producer or as an art lead.
											On all of the project that I've worked on, I've done some programming and/or work in-engine.	As an artist I enjoy implementing my assets and as an lead I
											encourage my fellow artists to do the same. Version control is also close to my heart, and I always use version control in my projects whether I'm working in a
											 team or alone.

											<h2>Turn-based VR strategy with time manipulation (2020)</h2>
										</header>
										<p>
											WIP	A VR-prototype for MeKiwi Oy. The prototype included 1st person shooter mechanics with time manipulation in a turn-based setting. This was my first project working
											as a full-time programmer and at first I was afraid If I had chewn off more than I could handle! But getting a prototype working, that is descpribed with words like
											VR, time manipulation, multiplayer, FPS and strategy, was as satisfying as programming gets! I've done some Unity and VR development before, but I learnt much
											about things such as events, state machines and good practices. The first week of production was used on learning about SOLID-principles and general programming 
											practices, which proved to be very valuable the further the development went. Total production time was around three to four months and I was the only programmer.

											<h2>Korpus: Buried Over the Black Soil (2019)</h2>
										</header>
										<p>	
											Production of Korpus: Buried Over the Black Soil started in January 2019 and was launched in early January 2020.
											I was the art lead and occasionally did some bugfixing and special effects 
											on top of 3D assets and managing the art team. The art team has had up to 6 people at a time and we've had people 
											joining and moving on to other projects, so managing each person's workload was quite the challenge.

											<h2>Santa's Calendar Gift Throw (2018)</h2>
										</header>
										<p>
											I worked as the lead artist in the mobile game Santa's Calendar Gift Throw. I coordinated the work of our 
											four-person team of artists, made backgrounds, other in-game sprites, UI-assets and UI-design. The game was made on 
											UE4 and I made all the in-engine particle effects and animations.

											<h2>Sabreurs - A Noble Duel (2018)</h2>
										</header>
										<p>
											Sabreurs - A Noble Duel was our first game on Steam. Our team had a total of seven people and I handled the production 
											tasks like scheduling, working with our publisher Kajak Games and team management. I also handled the marketing which 
											included handling our Twitter account, contacting influencers, updating the devlog and handling the production of physical 
											promotional assets. VFX and shaders were also my responsibility in this project.

											<h2>Panic! At The Kitchen (2018)</h2>
										</header>
										<p>
											Panic! At The Kitchen was a game made in two weeks for the International Game Concept Challenge with international teams 
											set by the organizers. The game is a 4-player local multiplayer with a heavy emphasis on player communication. Our team had 
											a total of six people. Due to us having only one programmer, I also did some programming like the level randomization, 
											shaders and worked with Unity's NavMesh. VFX, implementing the assets and making colliders was my responsibility. Our 
											team won the challenge, due to the most market potential and refreshing take on the communication between players.

										<h2>Skills</h2>
									</header>
									<p>
										My strongest skill is my ability to keep the project under control with good communication skills and level-headedness. 
										I'm a flexible worker, but most often I've been either a producer or an art lead. I enjoy learning about 3D-graphics, and I would descpribe
										myself as an artist if I had to pick a label. That is, if Unity-dev-generalist or art-lead are not acceptable labels.
										Be it the whole team or the art department, I feel like I'm responsible for everyone's peace of mind they're hard at work. 
										When the times are hectic, I enjoy getting my hands dirty and lifting some of the workload off of the team. Be it importing assets, 
										prototyping or helping out with marketing, I'm more than happy to jump in and do my part.

										<h2>Software and tools</h2>

										Through previous and current education and hobbies, I've become familiar with multiple sofware ranging from video editing to
